# Factory_GPT
An interactive secure chatbot which can answer internal data questions efficiently and can also give analytics about the data provided.
Nokia GPT is an AI-powered intelligent assistant designed to optimize industrial operations, automate quality checks, and enhance predictive maintenance in a smart manufacturing environment.
Developed for the Hackathon, this project integrates Generative AI, Computer Vision, and IoT data insights to bring intelligence to factory floors.

üß† Overview

Nokia GPT acts as a digital co-pilot for manufacturing engineers and operators.
It can:

Analyze production line data and generate actionable insights

Perform quality inspection using vision-based detection models

Predict potential machine failures using predictive maintenance analytics

Respond to natural language queries using GPT-powered dialogue

Integrate seamlessly with existing factory dashboards or robotic systems
